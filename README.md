# Mastering C++
Welcome to our **Mastering C++** Series. The Ultimate goal of our Series is to master the most critical skills in programming using the C++ Programming Language and that is the **Practical Edition**. as a plus you can gain advanced knowledge about different topics in programming and that is the **Concepts Edition**. 

## Mastering C++ (Practical Edition)

### Objectives

**Programming Skills**
* To be familiar with Cpp Syntax (or any other language you prefer to use)

**Problem Solving Skills** 
* To Practice a lot of competitve programming problems
* To be ready for Data Structures and Algorithms Topics  

**Project Building Skiils**
* To master the process of building projects 

**Object Oriented Design Skills**
* to master oop concepts 
* To be ready for other design patterns 

## Mastering C++ (Concepts Edition)
Concepts Edition is discussing different Programming Concepts that is applied to different programming languages like C++ 

### Big Picture 

**Programming Fundamentals**

 * Variables, Loops, Control Flow, Functions, Recursive Functions, Arrays (1D, 2D, ND) 

**Advanced Topics**
 * Pointers, STL, Templates, Headers, and Includes, Exception Handling, Compilation Process

**Object oriented programming**
 * Objects, Classes, Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Operator Overloading

**Modern C++ 11/14/17/20**
* Move Semantics, Perfect Forwarding, Variadic template, Folding expressions, Smart Pointers,
Lambda Expressions, Wrappers (Optional, Variant, Any, Functional)
